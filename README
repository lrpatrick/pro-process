README file for pro-process

This is the part of the PROMETEO database. These routines are used to introduce a new set of data into the database. 

These routines generate the PROMETEO normalised FITS and ASCII files that are required input for the database

So far these routines can process files from:

1. ESO (HARPS)
2. IACOB database
3. AAOmega - after much pre-processing
4. ING
